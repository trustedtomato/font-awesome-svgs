# Font Awesome SVGs

The current (2021-04-01) Font Awesome website doesn't give you a way to download or copy an icon's SVG code.
This project aims to resolve this issue.

## Live project
You can access the website at [trustedtomato.github.io/font-awesome-svgs/](trustedtomato.github.io/font-awesome-svgs/).

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
